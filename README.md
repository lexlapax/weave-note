# Weave Note App

A note app that supports the concepts of intertwingularity via graph semantics,
immutability via Content addressable storage

The intent is to build 
- first, a desktop (cross-platform) app that can take notes, serve as a multi media scratch pad and storage retreival note app
- a backend that uses content addressable storage that can be used separately from the desktop app if required
- a web based app
- a mobile app


The project structure is as such, and will be worked in that order
- serve - backend app code with apis
- dt - desktop app code
- web - web app code
